## Draft Digital Principles v. 0.2

### 1.       Prioritize delivering impact for British Columbians
Recognize that government digital products and services should ultimately improve people’s lives. Focus on meeting citizens’ needs and expectations and on improving service delivery. Build products and services for outcomes rather than outputs. Deliver consistently and sustainably through judicious use of public resources.

### 2.       Design with people & embed inclusion
Deliver simple, effective products and services via human-centered design practices with the people who will actually use the product or service. Apply the highest standards of accessibility, inclusion and equity at every stage of product and service design, development and delivery.

### 3.       Integrate ethics
Design or modify digital products and services with ethics in mind. Evaluate potential uses of emerging technologies to consider possible ethical, social and cultural implications. Ensure there is clear oversight and documentation for automated decision-making processes (e.g.: when using artificial intelligence).

### 4.       Continuously learn & improve
Iterate and improve products and services to support learning and innovation. Use modern tools and approaches. Be flexible to change, seeking and accepting ongoing user feedback. Test early and often. Start small and scale up.

### 5.       Work in the open
Collaborate, co-design and co-create with users transparently. Default towards open licenses, open and interoperable standards, open information and data, and open-source code.

### 6.       Take an ecosystem approach
Design and deliver solutions that are forward-thinking, adaptable and scalable. Support common components, interoperability and enterprise approaches. Share work and learnings with the aim of contributing to the wider community. Strive to collect data from users only once, re-using and sharing data whenever possible. 

### 7.       Take care of information & data
Manage information, including data, as a public asset in accordance with its value and user needs. Strive to improve the quality of information and data. Apply rigour around decision-making, using data to take a fair, ethical and evidence-based approach. Act as a trusted information steward.

### 8.       Manage risks proportionately
Promote a risk-balanced approach that addresses security and privacy. Design clear and flexible risk mitigation strategies.

### 9.       Build internal capacity
Empower all public servants to deliver excellent digital products and services. Create and support teams with diverse skillsets, providing them with technology, tools and training. Encourage innovation and controlled experimentation. Build an organizational culture that supports constant learning and engagement through the use of technology.

### 10.      Express cultural & historical awareness & respect
Acknowledge the historical relationships, inequity, trauma, and discrimination created by government; work in the spirit of reconciliation and [B.C.’s Draft Principles](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/about-the-bc-public-service/diversity-inclusion-respect/draft_principles.pdf) guiding our relationship with Indigenous peoples.
